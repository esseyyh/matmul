# Matmul implementations in c and cude to be used in htorch




## CPU implement 
1. naive c matmul                   done 
2. strassen's algorithm             done       
3. single thread optim  
    a.  tiling                      done
    b.  transpose                   done
    c.  vectorization               done
    d.  prefetch                    done 
    e.  unrolling                   done    
4. and finally multi threading

## GPU Implementation 

1. naive
2. tiling
